## ShowMyTouches currently supports:
  <li>Rootful, Rootless and Roothide jailbreaks</li>
  <li>Displaying interactions always or during screen recording only</li>
  <li>Multitouching</li>
  <li>Color picker</li>

## TO-DO:
  <li>Improve event handling. Currently, event waits for the animation to complete, which is not good.</li>

**ShowMyTouches preferences can be found in the iOS Settings, does not require respring**
